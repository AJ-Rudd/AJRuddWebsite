          <h1><strong>Story Anyone<strong></h1>
            <p>In this project people were invited to interact with a computer in
            a way they may not normally. A choice based game was created using
            Python. Then viewers were given instructions on a word document. The
            instructions taught them how to run a python program from the terminal
            step by step. They were aware I was video taping them, but I did not
            tell them that the computers webcam was recording them as well.
            As you'll see in the video the green light was on the whole time.
            At the end the viewer was told the webcam was recording the whole
            time, and the video captured their immediate reaction.</p>
