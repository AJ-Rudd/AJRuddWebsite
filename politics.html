          <h1><strong>Political Distraction(prototype)<strong></h1>
            <p>The goal of this project was to recreate the confusion surrounding politics
            and the media. I took Instagram comments from two political figures,
            who were on opposite ends of the political spectrum, and loaded
            the comments into a text to speech program on Iphones. I utilized
            bluetooth speakers to magnify the sound, so that it was like the two
            phones were arguing. The project is intended to be viewed in a dark
            room with only the sound being heard, and the screens being able to
            be viewed. Underneath the phones projecting the comments two Arduino
            screens were placed which held more obscure media information.
            Under one phone was the number of citizens in the middle east who had
            been killed since the war in Iraq began, and the other was the release
            date of Chelsea Manning from prison. Moving forward with this piece the
            comments, and obscure news stories would be displayed using projectors
            onto the walls, and the sound would be much more immersive.
