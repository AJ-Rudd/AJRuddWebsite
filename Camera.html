          <h1><strong>The Camera Sees All<strong></h1>
          <p>In this project a polaroid instax camera was wired to a tf-mini lidar sensor
          using an Arduino. Powered by a Lithium Ion battery the camera was placed around
          University of Marylands campus. The camera would take photos of people passing
          when it detected their motion. and print it out for them if they wanted to take it.
          After being that one person took their photo the rest of the images were put on a wall
          for a week long art performance. It started with putting the images on the wall in a public
          space and creating connections using string and tacks. From there connections were
          inferred that seemingly had no connection to each other to inspire passerby's to ask
          questions about what was happening. Several conversations occured throughout the week
          with people interested in the project. One person continued to come back every day
          and engage with the new content being added daily. The different colors represent a new
          day. </p>
